    <p>Greetings! I moved from New York to Florida this year, and I am currently a coding bootcamp student. I am learning the tools needed to become a full-stack web developer and hope to pursue a career in this field soon.
        </p>

        <p>I am a dog lover and have four dogs of my own. In fact, I created an iPhone application prototype that is intended to help connect rescue dogs with foster homes. I'm excited to develop this idea into a fully-functioning app!
