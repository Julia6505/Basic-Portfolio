        <p> Greetings! I moved from New York to Florida this year, and I am currently a coding bootcamp student. I am learning the tools needed to become a full-stack web developer and hope to pursue a career in this field soon.
        </p>
        <p>I am a dog lover and have four dogs of my own. In fact, I created an iPhone application prototype that is intended to help connect rescue dogs with foster homes. I'm excited to develop this idea into a fully-functioning app! 
         </p>
         <p>I love to be outside - hiking, visiting beaches and parks or just taking a simple walk around the neighborhood are fun activities. I miss the mountainous trails of New York, but look forward to discovering what Florida has to offer (when it's cool enough)!
